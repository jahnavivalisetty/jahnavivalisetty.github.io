    <h2>Research and Projects</h2>

    <h3>Hook Underwater â€“ Created a Game [Game Development from scratch | Photoshop | Unity | C#]</h3>
    <li>Developed a game called Hook Underwater.  Developed it by creating all the artwork in photoshop and the coding and development part in Unity using c#. Created and developed everything from scratch and made a complete fun, playable and challenging game. </li>

    <h3>Full Stack developement project for managing employees data - [ React | HTML | CSS | JS | Springboot | NodeJS | Java | XML | Eclipse | Hibernate | JPA | JSP | JDBC ] </h3>
    <li>Developed a full stack end-to-end web application which can (Create, Read, Update, Delete) employee system using React on front end and spring boot restful API on back end. </li>
    <li>Implemented Micro Services based using Spring Boot.</li>
    <li>Implemented Spring rest controllers.</li>
    <li>Implemented Spring data JPA for Service layer and used based repository interfaces (JPA/CRUD).</li>

    <h3>Analysis and extraction of required data from Huge Datasets [ Big Data Analytics | Hadoop | MapReduce | Spark | Cassandra | python]</h3>
    <li>Performed data analysis by extracting required data from a huge dataset efficiently in very less time using my own logic.</li>
    <li>Developed a pyspark code that parallelizes the sequence alignment operation to find the protein sequences which are matching to a single protein sequence by comparing the protein sequence to all the sequences in the database and then performed different measurements by changing different parameters to note down the observations that I observed by taking execution time into consideration.</li>
    <li>Found out the hourly concentration of o3 from pollutants of 2013 in Texas dataset by taking some constraints into consideration and found the execution time for different number of executors and observed the results. </li>
    <li>Converted the csv data file into parquet and json file formats by developing a pyspark code and compared the file size of the two new formats with the original csv file and compared the execution times as well for hourly concentration using all the three file formats and different number of executors.</li>
    <li>Perfomed the above action by importing data into Cassandra as well and observed the difference in execution times to find hourly concentration of o3 using different executors by taking csv file as input vs. by taking Cassandra table as input.</li>

    <h3>Comparing the performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) with feature selection versus support vector machine (SVM) with feature selection [ Artificial Intelligence | Neural Networks]</h3>
    <li>Presented different machine learning models using different machine learning algorithms and different feature selection methods to find a best model.</li>
    <li>The analysis of the result shows that the model built using ANN and wrapper feature selection outperformed all other models in classifying network traffic correctly with detection rate of 99.02%.</li>
    <li>In the ANN model, we experimented with different number of hidden layer and found that the detection success rate varies with the number of hidden layers. After several trial and error methods, we
      found best detection rate with 3 hidden layers and 0.1 learning rate. In the wrapper feature selection method, we also used SVM algorithm as classifier.</li>
    <li>I believe that these findings and model will certainly contribute to research further in various domainslike for building a detection system that can detect known attacks as well as novel network attacks, for gearbox fault
      diagnosis, for coal boiler plants using real time plant data and in various fields of medical diagnosis.</li>

    <h3>Personal Portfolio of mine [Front End | HTML | CSS]</h3>
    <li>This is the updated in-detail resume portfolio of mine which adjusts to any device perfectly and I did this using HTML and CSS. </li>

    <h3>Fuel Quote Prediction website [Software Designing | PHP | JS | Angular]</h3>
    <li>Predicted and generated fuel Quotes for each of the logged-in client based on various parameters using Javascript on front end and PHP on backend and mySQL using Agile methodology with three modules namely Registration Module, Pricing Module and Fuel Quote Generation Module and implemented various validations and authorization features.</li>

    <h3>Improving the performance of time series data analysis. [Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence]</h3>
    <li>Here we proposed a possible solution for the betterment of Time-series data analysis which deals with improving the performance of learning model by the combination of Bi-directional RNN + LSTM = Bi-LSTM + hyperparameter optimization (SMBO i.e., Bayesian optimization with TPE). This combination is proved to show better results when compared to other statistical models like ARIMA and GARCH which could not solve the problem of short term memory.</li>

    <h3>CUDA Renderer - Parallel Computation Lab using C programming [Parallel Computation, CUDA, C, C++]</h3>
